# 7th-grader wins national prize for designing space station for travel to Mars #

Emilia Dobek traces her interest in space and the universe back to third grade when she and her father watched blood moon--a total lunar eclipse--on the roof of their house.

Now a seventh-grader at East Prairie Elementary School, Dobek recently won the national Discovery Education Lockheed-Martin Beyond Challenge by designing a space station for traveling to Mars.

She says that night watching the lunar eclipse launched a passion in her that has yet to run out for fuel.

So when her enrichment teacher, Andrea Smeeton, received information about the national challenge, Smeeton said she immediately had one student in mind.

"I knew she would love the challenge and that she would go way beyond in her research," Smeeton said. "She immediately stated researching, bone density of astronauts and how to have sustenance on Mars."

"My design will ensure the safety of astronauts but also make sure their comfort is out of this world," Dobek says.

Dobek's design calls for building the MSS or Mars Storage Station to accommodate the need for abundant supplies. She explains how her spacecraft--the Adventurer--will dock into a space station before flying to the MSS to replenish supplies. Her design includes the SGF or Self-Growing Farm, and she details how it would work with the elements on Mars.

Then there is physical and leisure activity for the astronauts under Dobek's design.

A simulator allows astronauts to choose their exercise machine and virtual reality environment. Rooms have circular ceilings, she says, so astronauts will be able to watch downloaded shows and even see places on Earth, such as their homes.

Chief among her immediate goals, she said, is to inspire with this project.

"I want to tell other kids to follow their passions," Dobek said. "Whatever they want to do, they should kind of jsut push for it. They should always try their best."
