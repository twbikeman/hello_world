## A better prosthetic hand ##

Researchers from the Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute asked how, in effect, they could improve the user experience for amputees fitted with a prosthetic hand.

Their answer was as simple in theory as it was complex in execution: To feel in fuller command of an artificial appendage, they found the user of a prosthetic limb may just need a little buzz.

Cleveland Clinic's Paul Marasco and his colleagues devised a robotic system that, with every movement of an artificial hand, would deliver vibrations to the muscles in a user's arm that controlled that hand.

The location and intensity of those vibrations created for amputees an illusory "kinesthetic" sense that they were moving their own hand. Study subjects learned within minutes to use the vibratory feedback to more deftly move their mechanical hand, to better sense its position in space and to tighten and loosen their grip on objects as needed.

Once they got the system of feedback vibrations, participants were able to carry out a wide range of hand movements blindfolded.

"Establishing a sense of agency for these devices will help amputees intrinsically feel in control of their artificial limbs, a key aspect of user acceptance ," Marasco and his colleagues reported in the journal Science translational Medicine.

In the near future, the authors wrote, this approach could inspire wearable or other feedback systems that might allow amputees to guide and control their prosthetic limbs intuitively
