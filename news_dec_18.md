legoland's 'undersea' submarine ride

Legoland California is delivering an abundance of marine life--more than 1,000 sea animals, from stingrays to sharks--as it has debuted its version of submarine ride that goes underwater.

Standing in for an actual ocean is a 300,000-gallon aquarium populated with multiple species of sharks, rays and tropical fish, a feature that differentiates the park's Lego City Deep Sea Adventure attraction from other theme park submarine rides.

while the Carlsbad, California, park is no stranger to underwater life considering it also operates the Sea Life Aquarium, it is no small feat creating massive concrete-walled tank and the accompanying infrastructure needed to navigate 12-seat vehicles through the watery environment.

"Sea Life Aquarium is an extremely popular attraction here and part of the formula that makes Legoland a successful resort," said park president Peter Ronchetti. "So bringing that into the ride in a very controlled way opens up a whole new area of discovery for the children. ... It's something different for us. It's in an exciting environment, and we're bringing the ride and fish together in a whole new way."

The ride's story line is structured around a voyage in which the passengers are searching for sunken Lego artwork, swords and other treasures strategically located on the "ocean" bottom.

The real treasure-hunting quest begin s as passengers step down to board the submarine while it advances very slowly along the track. Once seated, riders can gaze out at the water via portholes or through large picture windows.

Above are individual touch screens where kids and adults can tap icons of treasures as they spot them in plain sight. The more treasures they successfully detect, the better their outcomes at the end of the ride as they strive to become a master explorer.
