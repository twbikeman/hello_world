4. Making building an emergency fund your priority
"You should build an emergency savings fund regardless of your debt burden," said Lowry. "Otherwise, when the inevitable emergency arises, it will have to get financed with credit cards."

However, you should make at least minimum payments on all your debts.

"Once you've built your emergency savings to between $1,000 to $1,500, then you can redirect your focus towards putting more money towards your debt," said Lowry. "You can also focus on ways to be earning more money during this time period on order to pad your savings or pay down debt more aggressively"

5. Crate a budget
"If you have debt, be sure to complete a budget to determine how much you can afford to put towards your debt and savings," said Broadway. "Ideally, at least 10 percent should be set towards debt and 10 percent towards savings, unless your are tackling your debt aggressively. Once you knock out the debt, save a least 20 percent and increase the percentage as your income increases."

6. Use financial planning software

"My favorite money tool is Person Capital," said Broadway. "This finance tool can help you see your net worth, your overall financial picture and help you plan your future. Plus, it's free. In addition, apps such as Mint, Personal Capital and You Need a Budget are  great to ensure you are on track to reach your money goals."

7. Figure out your savings goals

"How much you should have saved depends on the goal of your savings account," said Schroede Gardner. "Is it for retirement, a vacation, an emergency fund or something else?"

She said it's important to set short-, medium- and long-term savings goals.

8. Automate savings contributions

"Set up savings to be automatic because you need to pay yourself first," said Brittney Castro, founder of Financially Wise Women. "Then you don't have to think about it, and it's happening every month without you needing to lift a finger."
