## A positive 'thumbprint' ##
Why is it that we tend to clearly remember and may influenced by something that happens when we are under stress?

We may never forget the comforting arm and gentle word when we wept or the shove and harsh word. The cool touch on feverish brow or cold sneer at misfortune.

## Discovering your softer side ##


When such things are said or done, especially in challenging times, we seriously remember--often for the rest of our lives. Perhaps it is because we are more malleable then. Malleable ... like softened clay.

Although I am no ceramics expert , allow me to use a metaphor from working with clay. Most folks know that if you press you thumb into a block  of stiff clay, the imprint is shallow and insignificant. But if you soften the clay and it becomes malleable, and then press in your thumb, the impression is deep and definitive.

In my experience working with folks in crisis, people are more impressionable when in crisis or distressed. The stiffness of one's presumed, planned, orderly life is mashed down again and again in a multitude of ways. Solid certitudes become far less certain in the face of life's vulnerabilities, struggles and mysteries.

And then, when the clay of one's being is softer and more pliable, the impression happens ... for better or for worse.

## 'Make a good impression' ##

Sometimes we cannot control the thumbprints that press in on our lives, nor can we control the state of another person's clay. However, we can control our verbal and behavioral interactions and, specifically, our impressions that we may make.

You may be the formal or informal teacher who says the right thing at the right time, or the receptive student. You may be the person for whom someone stopped to lend a hand at just the right time and circumstance.

Since we are all made of clay, today is a good day to make a good impression.
