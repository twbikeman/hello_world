I sailed north from Misool to the Fam Islands, where pincushions of bush-clad rock jut out from the sea, forming a labyrinth of earth and water. Then it was off to investigate Papuan culture at Arborek Tourism Village and, eventually, onto the nearby island of Waigeo.

## The birdwatching finale ##

On my penultimate day in Raja Ampat, I wake up at the uncomfortable hour of 4 a.m. and prepare myself for an hour-long hike into the jungle. A full moon sends icicles of white light across the sea as I motor to a small dock. As we get closer, I spot my bird guide, Daniel, waving a flashlight.

We hike together under the soft glow of a flashlight, stepping over rocks, roots and moss-covered logs on our way to a crude viewing blind in a hilltop forest 650 feet above the sea. A cacophony of birdsong greets us as we rise higher into the jungle.

I manage to reach the viewing blind by sunrise and survey my surroundings. There are sturdy buttress roots below and pen-thin palms towering above the forest canopy.  Vines swirl around a nearby  eucalyptus tree, choking it.

I spot the first signs of movement in a distant branch. It takes a few long minutes, but a creature finally emerges from the leaves. It has an elaborate outfit that even a peacock would envy: crimson red wings, emerald green cheeks, yellow shoulder tufts and wispy purple tail feathers that curve away from its body. It truly is paradise embodied.

By 4 a.m., the sun has crested above the horizon and the birds, like clockwork, dissipate into the forest in search of food.

For me, it's the culmination of a long journey to a faraway archipelago I won't soon forget.
