I sailed north from Misool to the Fam Islands, where pincushions of bush-clad rock jut out from the sea, forming a labyrinth of earth and water. Then it was off to investigate Papuan culture at Arborek Tourism Village and, eventually, onto the nearby island of Waigeo.

## The birdwatching finale ##

On my penultimate day in Raja Ampat, I wake up at the uncomfortable hour of 4 a.m. and prepare myself for an hour-long hike into the jungle. A full moon sends icicles of white light across the sea as I motor to a small dock. As we get closer, I spot my bird guide, Daniel, waving a flashlight.

We hike together under the soft glow of a flashlight, stepping over rocks, roots and moss-covered logs on our way to a crude viewing blind in a hilltop forest 650 feet above the sea. A cacophony of birdsong greets us as we rise higher into the jungle.

I manage to reach the viewing blind by sunrise and survey my surroundings. There are sturdy buttress roots below and pen-thin palms towering above the forest canopy.  Vines swirl around a nearby  eucalyptus tree, choking it.

I spot the first signs of movement in a distant branch. It takes a few long minutes, but a creature finally emerges from the leaves. It has an elaborate outfit that even a peacock would envy: crimson red wings, emerald green cheeks, yellow shoulder tufts and wispy purple tail feathers that curve away from its body. It truly is paradise embodied.

By 4 a.m., the sun has crested above the horizon and the birds, like clockwork, dissipate into the forest in search of food.

For me, it's the culmination of a long journey to a faraway archipelago I won't soon forget.


# Eight hotel checkout reminders #

Knowing what not to do at checkout and properly preparing for it can turn a potentially heated situation into a quick thank you and goodbye. Below we compiled a list of eight things you should remember at hotel checkout.

1. Don't be late to checkout
 Hotels may tack on an outrageously high price for being just a half-hour late. If you know you won't make the cutoff time, it never hurts to call ahead and try to negotiate away a potential charge.

2. Don't forget to double check the room and safe

make sure you don't leave anything behind. If you have an early flight or checkout time, pack up as much as you can the night before so that last-minute rush isn't too  harried. Also, be sure to take out anything in the room safe.

3. Don't forget to tip the housekeepers

It's always polite to leave some money for the people keeping your room clean.

4. Don't ignore the itemized bill

You may be in a rush, but give the itemized bill a careful look to see if the hotel charge is different than the rate you initially booked.

5. Don't be surprised by hidden  charges
Research the fees your hotel charges before you book your stay. The property should clearly spell out the fees they add to the bill, and if not, you can push back on any surprise charges.

6. Don't freak out
Spitting venom at the assistant manager standing behind the front desk probabl6 won't help when dealing with an unexpected line item on the bill. Be empathetic about how difficult it can be deal with annoyed customers will likely go much further. If the fee wasn't disclosed beforehand, you bay be able to get it waived. You can also try to dispute a charge later through your credit card company.

7. Don't pay with cash or debit card
Dispute you bill after paying with cash is a lot harder than working with credit card company to get a charge back. If you pay with a debit card, you may not have the protection to challenge a charge.

8. Dont have the hotel call you a cab

If you want to save a few dollars, plan ahead and check if a ride-sharing service is going to be cheaper than a cab to the airport.
