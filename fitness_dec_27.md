# Get some fitness inspiration from these **amputees** and their running buddies #

The irony of Mike Dimas organizing the Happy Feat Foundation relay teams for the BMW Dallas Marathon is twofold:

First, he doesn't particularly like running. And second, he's only running at all because he had his leg amputated, which is arguably the best excuse for never running.

## A life-saving amputation ##

Dimas contracted necrotizing fasciitis, more descriptively known as flesh-eating bacteria. It almost killed him; instead, doctors save his life by removing his left leg just below the knee.

That led to walking, to running and , eventually, to setting up the foundation. The evolution was slow and not always sure. But Dimas's family, friends and medical professionals gave a not-always-gentle push.

## A flash of inspiration ##

An instrumental influence has been Kai Davis, a prosthetist at Texas Vascular Associates. The first time he and Dimas met, two months after Dimas' amputation, Davis explained what the new leg would look like and all it would be able to do. As encouraging as its features sounded, and as supportive as Davis was, Dimas said all he could think about was that he had no money, no job, no insurance. He wondered how he'd pay rent, much less thousands of dollars for a state-of-the-art artificial leg.

Davis' answer to that was simple: "We've got you covered."

Dimas isn't one to cry, but after leaving his appointment, he closed his car door and wept.

"I'd say that is where the seed to start the Happy Feat Foundation was planted," he says.

## Living 'without limits' ##

"The amputees on my team, like a lot of amputees, are living lives without limits and pushing themselves to be as active as they can be," Dimas says. "I hope to show a little of that spirit through this Happy Feat project. Long gone is the day when an amputation relegates you to a sedentary lifestyle, watching life got by from the sidelines."
